## FIFA21_PROJECT 
 
FIFA 21 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Artsâ€™ FIFA series. As a football fan since childhood, I am excited to perform Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, EDA and Modelling using FIFA 21 player dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ekrembayar/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset?select=fifa21_male2.csv).

The dataset contains information of all **17125** players from FIFA 21 edition. There are **106 attributes** including Age, Nationality, Overall, Potential, Club, Value, Wage, Preferred Foot, International Reputation, Weak Foot, Skill Moves, Work Rate, Position, Jersey Number, Joined, Loaned From, Contract Valid Until, Height, Weight among others.

The steps for this process are as follows:

<span style="color:blue">Data Cleaning</span> : Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, renaming columns, handling inconsistencies in data...
**Data Wrangling**: Filtering rows based on conditions, Sorting data,Reshaping data, Grouping data based on categories...

**Hypothesis**:
Let's imagine that one of the top teams in the world is interested in signing a player for the next season and has to make a decision soon. We will identify the best options by answering the following questions:

1. Who are the 10 best players according to their statistics and performance?
3. Who are the  best players in every position in the game?
4. Who are the 5 players under 25 years old with the highest potential?
5. Players with the highest release clauses and their Ratings
6. What is the player's salary and market value compared to other players in the same position?


**EDA**: computing statistics, cratin visualization to explore data, exploring distribution, identifying correlations, detecting patterns and trends in data.

Splitting data into Feature and Label sets
Train/Test Split data
Transform data for training a Linear Regression model
Train and Test models using normalized and standardized numerical data.
